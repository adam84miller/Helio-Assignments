<!--
   ** How do you think XML relates to HTML? 
    
      Xml is also a markup language however it's dealing with data exclusively rather than making the 
      data look nice visually

   ** What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?  

      XML doesn't use predetermined tags as HTML does. It simplifies data sharing as well, if 
      incompatible data is used XML can be used also.

   ** What are some disadvantages? 

      It's super tedious and doesn't neccesarily look the greatest.
